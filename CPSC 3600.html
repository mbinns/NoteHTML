Topic - Support Protocols and Technologies Pt.2

</ul>
<li>
Computer Networks vs Distributed Systems:

<ul>
<li>
Computer networks:

<ul>
<li>
Interconnected collection of computer ables to exchange info

<li>
Usually requires to explicitly login and explicitly do tasks

</ul>
<li>
Distributed systems:

<ul>
<li>
Multiple autonomous computers in a network and is transparent to the user

<li>
The operating system automatically allocates, jobs, tasks, resources without explicite instruction

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Motivation for computer network apps:

<ul>
<li>
Business networks:

<ul>
<li>
Resource sharing:

<ul>
<li>
Can share files 

<li>
Data can be transfered quickly

<li>
Things can work reguardless of physical location

</ul>
<li>
High reliablility:

<ul>
<li>
Data can be duplicated across multiple devices providing redundancy

</ul>
<li>
Economically sound:

<ul>
<li>
Networked micro computers using the client server model offer better price performance ratio than mainframes

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Personal networks:

<ul>
<li>
Access to remote information:

<ul>
<li>
Financial info

<li>
database access using peer to peer model:

<ul>
<li>
No central server usually hosted on a users computer

<li>
Torrents (P2P)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Person to person communication:

<ul>
<li>
Email

<li>
Voice

<li>
Video

</ul>
<li>
Interactive entertainment:

<ul>
<li>
Video on demand

<li>
Interactive tv

<li>
Networked games

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Classification of computer networks:

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast:

<ul>
<li>
Uses a single comm channel used by all computers on the network

<li>
Short messages (Packets) are sent by any machine and recieved by all computers

<li>
An address is used in the message to select the target (IP)

<li>
Most localized networks are broadcast

</ul>
<li>
Point to point:

<ul>
<li>
Consist of many connections between individual pairs of machines

<li>
A packet may have to visit one or more intermediate machines before reaching its target:

<ul>
<li>
A Router is an intermediate node in this type of network

</ul>
<li>
Routing algorithms play an important role

<li>
Most large area networks use this model

</ul>
<li>
Based on scale:

<ul>
<li>
PAN Personal area networs (Smallest scale):

<ul>
<li>
Devices communicate over the range of a person 

<li>
Bluetooth is a good example of this

</ul>
<li>
LAN Local area Network:

<ul>
<li>
Rooms, buildings, Sites

<li>
Only one machine can transmit successfully unless switches are used

</ul>
<li>
MAN Metropolitan area Networks:

<ul>
<li>
Whole city range

</ul>
<li>
WAN Wide area Networks:

<ul>
<li>
Consited of hosts (machines to run applications)

<li>
Consists of multiple LANS using communication subnets to interact with one another

<ul>
<li>
Routers act as the intermediate nodes bewtween the networks

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Global networks (The internet):

<ul>
<li>
Internetworks are teh netwokrs with different software and hardware interconnected as one network

<li>
Gateways are computers used to translate between all computers

<li>
ARPANET is the first implementation of this:

<ul>
<li>
Expanded by the NSF (several thousnd)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
TCP/IP is the current protocol for comm

</ul>
