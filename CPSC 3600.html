<ul>
<li>
Topic - Support Protocols and Technologies Pt.2

</ul>
<li>
Computer Networks vs Distributed Systems:

<ul>
<li>
Computer networks:

<ul>
<li>
Interconnected collection of computer ables to exchange info

<li>
Usually requires to explicitly login and explicitly do tasks

</ul>
<li>
Distributed systems:

<ul>
<li>
Multiple autonomous computers in a network and is transparent to the user

<li>
The operating system automatically allocates, jobs, tasks, resources without explicite instruction

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Motivation for computer network apps:

<ul>
<li>
Business networks:

<ul>
<li>
Resource sharing:

<ul>
<li>
Can share files 

<li>
Data can be transfered quickly

<li>
Things can work reguardless of physical location

</ul>
<li>
High reliablility:

<ul>
<li>
Data can be duplicated across multiple devices providing redundancy

</ul>
<li>
Economically sound:

<ul>
<li>
Networked micro computers using the client server model offer better price performance ratio than mainframes

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Personal networks:

<ul>
<li>
Access to remote information:

<ul>
<li>
Financial info

<li>
database access using peer to peer model:

<ul>
<li>
No central server usually hosted on a users computer

<li>
Torrents (P2P)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Person to person communication:

<ul>
<li>
Email

<li>
Voice

<li>
Video

</ul>
<li>
Interactive entertainment:

<ul>
<li>
Video on demand

<li>
Interactive tv

<li>
Networked games

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Classification of computer networks:

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast:

<ul>
<li>
Uses a single comm channel used by all computers on the network

<li>
Short messages (Packets) are sent by any machine and recieved by all computers

<li>
An address is used in the message to select the target (IP)

<li>
Most localized networks are broadcast

</ul>
<li>
Point to point:

<ul>
<li>
Consist of many connections between individual pairs of machines

<li>
A packet may have to visit one or more intermediate machines before reaching its target:

<ul>
<li>
A Router is an intermediate node in this type of network

</ul>
<li>
Routing algorithms play an important role

<li>
Most large area networks use this model

</ul>
<li>
Based on scale:

<ul>
<li>
PAN Personal area networs (Smallest scale):

<ul>
<li>
Devices communicate over the range of a person 

<li>
Bluetooth is a good example of this

</ul>
<li>
LAN Local area Network:

<ul>
<li>
Rooms, buildings, Sites

<li>
Only one machine can transmit successfully unless switches are used

</ul>
<li>
MAN Metropolitan area Networks:

<ul>
<li>
Whole city range

</ul>
<li>
WAN Wide area Networks:

<ul>
<li>
Consited of hosts (machines to run applications)

<li>
Consists of multiple LANS using communication subnets to interact with one another

<ul>
<li>
Routers act as the intermediate nodes bewtween the networks

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Global networks (The internet):

<ul>
<li>
Internetworks are teh netwokrs with different software and hardware interconnected as one network

<li>
Gateways are computers used to translate between all computers

<li>
ARPANET is the first implementation of this:

<ul>
<li>
Expanded by the NSF (several thousnd)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
TCP/IP is the current protocol for comm

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Protocol Hierarchy:

<ul>
<li>
To reduce design complecity, most networks are orgainized in layers

<li>
Layers may be implemented in software or hardware depending on function

<li>
Layers can communicate with layers on other machines on the network using an agreed upon protocol

<li>
Layers trickle down from the higher to lower numbers then back up on the reciving machine

</ul>
<li>
Protocol:

<ul>
<li>
An agreement between layers on how the communication is to proceede

<li>
The steps that need to take place on how the computer will communicate

<li>
Similar to speaking the same language as someone

</ul>
<li>
Layers:

<ul>
<li>
Lower layers specify how the bits are sent

<li>
Higher levels (Application level) contain information an application can use

<li>
Protocols on a per layer basis allow for different configurations to communicate with one anaother

<li>
No data is transferred from layer n on any two machines data and control is passed to the layer below

<li>
Protocol information is appended as a header on the packet

<li>
After layer 1 the phyisical medium where the actual communication occurs

</ul>
<li>
Information flow in a network:

<ul>
<li>
After every layer the next layers header is appended on the front
<pre>
    LNH = Layer number header (Appended at each descending layer)
    Layer 5 [Message]
    Layer 4 [L4H][Message]
    Layer 3 [L3H][L4H][Message]
    Layer 2 [L2H][L3H][L4H][Message]
    Layer 1 [L1H][L2H][L3H][L4H][Message]
    Physical medium
</pre>

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Design issues for layers:

<ul>
<li>
Robustness:

<ul>
<li>
Error detection: Retransimission is needed when information is received incorrectly

<li>
Error correction: Message is recovered from incorrect bits

<li>
Routing: Automatically fin an alternative route from source to desitination

</ul>
<li>
Scalability:

<ul>
<li>
Protocol layering: divides the overall problem and hides implementation details

<li>
Addressing: Naming and identifying senders and receivers

</ul>
<li>
Resource allocation:

<ul>
<li>
Statisitcal multiplexing: allocating bandwidth dynamically according to the short term needs of hosts

<li>
Flow control: feedback from the receiver to the sender is used to overcome the fast sender slow receiver problem:

<ul>
<li>
If the sender is on fiber and the receiver is on DSL the sender can send many more packets than the receiver can get

<li>
So the ACK packet is inplace to let the sender know what packets the receiver has gotten

</ul>
<li>
Congestion: Too many computer on a network at one time

<li>
Real-time: Timeliness

<li>
Quality of service: High throughput, low latency:

<ul>
<li>
Can send lots of data very quickly

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Security:

<ul>
<li>
Confidentiality: Prevents eavesdropping

<li>
Authentication: Prevents someone from impersonating someone else

<li>
Integrety: Make sure the data does not change from point 'A' to point 'B'

</ul>
</ul>
