Topic - Support Protocols and Technologies Pt.2

</ul>
<li>
Computer Networks vs Distributed Systems:

<ul>
<li>
Computer networks:

<ul>
<li>
Interconnected collection of computer ables to exchange info

<li>
Usually requires to explicitly login and explicitly do tasks

</ul>
<li>
Distributed systems:

<ul>
<li>
Multiple autonomous computers in a network and is transparent to the user

<li>
The operating system automatically allocates, jobs, tasks, resources without explicite instruction

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Motivation for computer network apps:

<ul>
<li>
Business networks:

<ul>
<li>
Resource sharing:

<ul>
<li>
Can share files 

<li>
Data can be transfered quickly

<li>
Things can work reguardless of physical location

</ul>
<li>
High reliablility:

<ul>
<li>
Data can be duplicated across multiple devices providing redundancy

</ul>
<li>
Economically sound:

<ul>
<li>
Networked micro computers using the client server model offer better price performance ratio than mainframes

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Personal networks:

<ul>
<li>
Access to remote information:

<ul>
<li>
Financial info

<li>
database access using peer to peer model:

<ul>
<li>
No central server usually hosted on a users computer

<li>
Torrents (P2P)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Person to person communication:

<ul>
<li>
Email

<li>
Voice

<li>
Video

</ul>
<li>
Interactive entertainment:

<ul>
<li>
Video on demand

<li>
Interactive tv

<li>
Networked games

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Classification of computer networks:

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast:

<ul>
<li>
Uses a single comm channel used by all computers on the network

<li>
Short messages (Packets) are sent by any machine and recieved by all computers

<li>
An address is used in the message to select the target (IP)

<li>
Most localized networks are broadcast

</ul>
<li>
Point to point:

<ul>
<li>
Consist of many connections between individual pairs of machines

<li>
A packet may have to visit one or more intermediate machines before reaching its target:

<ul>
<li>
A Router is an intermediate node in this type of network

</ul>
<li>
Routing algorithms play an important role

<li>
Most large area networks use this model

</ul>
<li>
Based on scale:

<ul>
<li>
PAN Personal area networs (Smallest scale):

<ul>
<li>
Devices communicate over the range of a person 

<li>
Bluetooth is a good example of this

</ul>
<li>
LAN Local area Network:

<ul>
<li>
Rooms, buildings, Sites

<li>
Only one machine can transmit successfully unless switches are used

</ul>
<li>
MAN Metropolitan area Networks:

<ul>
<li>
Whole city range

</ul>
<li>
WAN Wide area Networks:

<ul>
<li>
Consited of hosts (machines to run applications)

<li>
Consists of multiple LANS using communication subnets to interact with one another

<ul>
<li>
Routers act as the intermediate nodes bewtween the networks

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Global networks (The internet):

<ul>
<li>
Internetworks are teh netwokrs with different software and hardware interconnected as one network

<li>
Gateways are computers used to translate between all computers

<li>
ARPANET is the first implementation of this:

<ul>
<li>
Expanded by the NSF (several thousnd)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
TCP/IP is the current protocol for comm

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Protocol Hierarchy:

<ul>
<li>
To reduce design complecity, most networks are orgainized in layers

<li>
Layers may be implemented in software or hardware depending on function

<li>
Layers can communicate with layers on other machines on the network using an agreed upon protocol

<li>
Layers trickle down from the higher to lower numbers then back up on the reciving machine

</ul>
<li>
Protocol:

<ul>
<li>
An agreement between layers on how the communication is to proceede

<li>
The steps that need to take place on how the computer will communicate

<li>
Similar to speaking the same language as someone

</ul>
<li>
Layers:

<ul>
<li>
Lower layers specify how the bits are sent

<li>
Higher levels (Application level) contain information an application can use

<li>
Protocols on a per layer basis allow for different configurations to communicate with one anaother

<li>
No data is transferred from layer n on any two machines data and control is passed to the layer below

<li>
Protocol information is appended as a header on the packet

<li>
After layer 1 the phyisical medium where the actual communication occurs

</ul>
<li>
Information flow in a network:

<ul>
<li>
After every layer the next layers header is appended on the front
<pre>
    LNH = Layer number header (Appended at each descending layer)
    Layer 5 [Message]
    Layer 4 [L4H][Message]
    Layer 3 [L3H][L4H][Message]
    Layer 2 [L2H][L3H][L4H][Message]
    Layer 1 [L1H][L2H][L3H][L4H][Message]
    Physical medium
</pre>

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Design issues for layers:

<ul>
<li>
Robustness:

<ul>
<li>
Error detection: Retransimission is needed when information is received incorrectly

<li>
Error correction: Message is recovered from incorrect bits

<li>
Routing: Automatically fin an alternative route from source to desitination

</ul>
<li>
Scalability:

<ul>
<li>
Protocol layering: divides the overall problem and hides implementation details

<li>
Addressing: Naming and identifying senders and receivers

</ul>
<li>
Resource allocation:

<ul>
<li>
Statisitcal multiplexing: allocating bandwidth dynamically according to the short term needs of hosts

<li>
Flow control: feedback from the receiver to the sender is used to overcome the fast sender slow receiver problem:

<ul>
<li>
If the sender is on fiber and the receiver is on DSL the sender can send many more packets than the receiver can get

<li>
So the ACK packet is inplace to let the sender know what packets the receiver has gotten

</ul>
<li>
Congestion: Too many computer on a network at one time

<li>
Real-time: Timeliness

<li>
Quality of service: High throughput, low latency:

<ul>
<li>
Can send lots of data very quickly

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Security:

<ul>
<li>
Confidentiality: Prevents eavesdropping

<li>
Authentication: Prevents someone from impersonating someone else

<li>
Integrety: Make sure the data does not change from point 'A' to point 'B'

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Network layer services:

<ul>
<li>
Connection orienteed service:

<ul>
<li>
The data is expected to be recived in the order it was sent

<li>
TCP

</ul>
<li>
Connetionless service:

<ul>
<li>
The messages are self contained and are routed independent in the order they were sent

<li>
Therefore messages can be recived out of order
<pre>
First 3 are connection oriented
The rest are connectionless

| Services                | Example              |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Reliable message stream | Sequence of pages    |
| Reliable byte stream    | Movie download       |
| Unreliable connection   | VOIP                 |
| Unreliable datagram     | Electronic junk mail |
| Acknoledged datagram    | Text messaging       |
| Request reply           | Database query       |
</pre>

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
OSI 7 layer network model:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;OSI_mode:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;OSI_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_mode://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</a>

<li>
This is the first step to an international standard of network communication 

<li>
Physical layer:

<ul>
<li>
This layer is concered with tranmission of bits

<li>
Some issues handeled are:

<ul>
<li>
How many volts for 0 and how many volts for 1

<li>
number of bits persecond

<li>
Whether it is a one-way or two-way communication

</ul>
<li>
Serial ports are a good example of this

</ul>
<li>
Data link layer:

<ul>
<li>
This layer groups bits into frames (Packets) and ensures correct delivery free of errors

<li>
It adds some bits at the beginning and end of each frame to be used as a check sum:

<ul>
<li>
The receiver makes sure the checksum is correct and if it is not correct will request a retransmmission

</ul>
<li>
This layer has two sublayers:

<ul>
<li>
Logical link contol:

<ul>
<li>
LLC defines how data is transferred over network medium and connects to higher layers

</ul>
<li>
Medium access control:

<ul>
<li>
MAC defines who can use the network medium when multiple computers are trying to access it

</ul>
<li>
Token passing - Kinda like holding the speaking stick, whoever holds the token can transmit data

<li>
Carrier sense multiple access with collision avidance (CSMA/CD) for ethernet:
<pre>


    B           D
                    
A       C           E

If both A and C send something to B then there will be a collision and only one can send at a time
But if C sends to D and A sends to B then they can both send at the same time imagin drawing lines between the points and if theyy intersect then it would be a collision
</pre>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
OSI 7 layer network model:

<ul>
<li>
Network layer:

<ul>
<li>
This layer is concerend with the transmission of packets and how they are routed from source to destination

<li>
Path finding algorithms are used here (Shortest path without conflicts):

<ul>
<li>
If congestion is present on one host that is on the shortest path, the next best path  will be used

</ul>
<li>
Congestion occurs when too many packets are present at the same time:

<ul>
<li>
If many computers route through one host and the host cannot handle the load it is a bottleneck on the network

</ul>
<li>
In broadcast networks routing is easy (It goes to everyone) so this layer is not very important:

<ul>
<li>
Sometimes it doesn't even exist

</ul>
<li>
In larger networks this layer is very complicated (The internet)

</ul>
<li>
Transport layer:

<ul>
<li>
Deals with lots of messages and must be reliable

<li>
Breaks messages into small packets of data and applies a sequence to them:

<ul>
<li>
The syn/ack number in TCP threeway handshake

</ul>
<li>
Examples are tranmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP):

</ul>
<li>
Session layer:

<ul>
<li>
Few applications use this layer, more enhanced verstion of transport

<li>
Use cases:

<ul>
<li>
Dialog control:

<ul>
<li>
Whos turn it is to send packets

</ul>
<li>
Token management:

<ul>
<li>
To keep track of identity

</ul>
<li>
Synchronization:

<ul>
<li>
Checkpoints for long transmissions

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Many network implementations don't support this layer

</ul>
<li>
Presentation layer:

<ul>
<li>
Few applications use this layer

<li>
Use cases:

<ul>
<li>
Syntax and sematincs of info transmitted

</ul>
<li>
Allows machines with different represenations to communicate

</ul>
<li>
Application layer:

<ul>
<li>
This is a collection of protocols for high level applications

<li>
VOIP, web browsing, ssh

<li>
Protocols include:

<ul>
<li>
HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/Telnet

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Data transmission:

<ul>
<li>
Sender works from the top down (With the highest level layer needed)

<li>
Reciver works from the bottom up (From the physical layer up)

</ul>
<li>
TCP/IP reference model:

<ul>
<li>
Used in the internet

<li>
Only 5 layers

<ul>
<li>
Application 5:

<ul>
<li>
Specifies format of the data that is usful for an application 

</ul>
<li>
Transport 4:

<ul>
<li>
Provides communication from an application on one computer to an app on another

<li>
Controlls max rate of data flow

<li>
Avoids congestion

<li>
Keeps order of packets

<li>
Main differences between OSI model and TCP:

<ul>
<li>
They are typically the same in both model 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Internet 3:

<ul>
<li>
Similar to the network layer in OSI

<li>
Communication between two computers across the internet, the internet addressing structure of the packets

</ul>
<li>
Network interface 2:

<ul>
<li>
This is the data link layer in OSI

<li>
MAC layer specifies details about comm over a singal network address and max packet size

</ul>
<li>
Physical 1:

<ul>
<li>
Same as the OSI model

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Client server models:

<ul>
<li>
Client and servers are not refering to the physical computer but the types of applications on them

<ul>
<li>
Client:

<ul>
<li>
Program initiates communication

</ul>
<li>
Server:

<ul>
<li>
Waits passivly for and then responds to messages

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
A computer can be both client and server at the same time

<li>
Example: You want to download a movie from a computer, you send a request (Making you the client) and the computer on the internet sends you a response in the form of a movie (The server) but you host a website on your computer (Making you the server) and someone wants to go to your site so they send a request to see it to your computer (Making them the client). This can all happen at the same time

<li>
Model of interaction:
<table>
<tr>
<th>
Server
</th>
<th>
Client
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Starts first
</td>
<td>
Starts second
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Does not need to know which client will contact it
</td>
<td>
Must know what server to contact
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Waits passivly for contact
</td>
<td>
Initiates contact
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Communication with a client starts by both sending And reciving data
</td>
<td>
Communicates by sending and reciving data
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Stays running after transaction
</td>
<td>
May terminate after transaction
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<li>
How does a client identify a server:

<ul>
<li>
Know the IP of the server (or resolvable dns name)

</ul>
<li>
How does a client know what to application to talk to on the server:

<ul>
<li>
A port number is used for a channel of communication for a particular application

<li>
Differnet applications can use the same port number <span id="CPSC 3600-8&#47;24&#47;16-BUT"></span><strong id="BUT">BUT</strong> only one application can run on that port at any given time:

<ul>
<li>
Email port number:25 (SMTP)

<li>
Web server port number:80 (HTTP)

<li>
Secure web server port number: 443 (HTTPS)

</ul>
<li>
Multiple clients can communicate over one port at the sametime

<li>
<a href="https:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers</a> 

</ul>
<li>
What is a socket:

<ul>
<li>
A socket is an abstraction through which and application may send data

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
TCP/UDP:

<ul>
<li>
TCP Relaiable and connection oriented:

<ul>
<li>
Has error checking and overhead built in to make sure the packet was recived

</ul>
<li>
UDP unreliable connectionless:

<ul>
<li>
Typically faster than TCP due to less overhead in ensuring packet transmission

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
