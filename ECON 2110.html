<ul>
<li>
Study of how people allocate their limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wants

<li>
Key Concepts:

<ul>
<li>
Incentives:

<ul>
<li>
Incentives are the rewards or punishments that people respond to

<li>
Most common birthday in the U.S is the New Year:

<ul>
<li>
This is because you get to claim a deduction on your taxes if the child is born before the 31st

</ul>
<li>
People respond to incentives "Particularly on the margin":

<ul>
<li>
On the margin says that not everyone will respond to incentive, but at least some people will respond if enough incentive is provided

</ul>
<li>
Institution:

<ul>
<li>
Basically the rules of the game

<li>
Any kind of establishment or group of people who are going to enforce social norms and laws and promote wealth

<ul>
<li>
HOA

<li>
Government

<li>
Board of directors

</ul>
<li>
The free market is created and protected by institutions

<ul>
<li>
Adam smith created the metaphor 'The Invisible Hand'

<ul>
<li>
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest"

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Scarcity:

<ul>
<li>
Goods are defined as scarce if you need to give up something to get it

<li>
We live in a world of finite resources

<li>
People have unlimited needs and wants

<li>
"Everything is scarce"

<li>
Trade offs:

<ul>
<li>
Because goods are scarce we nearly always must give up one thing for another

<li>
Trade offs are everywhere

<li>
Opportunity Cost:

<ul>
<li>
The opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the one next best alternative

<li>
Can be measured in money, time or activity given up

<li>
Does everyone have the same opportunity cost for the same action

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Trade-offs:

<ul>
<li>

<div id="Exam 1-1&#47;24&#47;17-Postive and Normative Econ"><h3 id="Postive and Normative Econ">Postive and Normative Econ</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Positive Econ describes how the economy actually works:

<ul>
<li>
Can be true or false

<li>
Can be tested by looking at the facts

</ul>
<li>
Normative econ describes an opinion of how the economy should work:

<ul>
<li>
Value judgements, Identify problems

</ul>
<li>
Thinking on the Margin:

<ul>
<li>
Ration individuals compare the marginal benefit of an action against its marginal cost

<li>
Exmaple:

<ul>
<li>
Is shopping at costco worth it

<li>
Suppose you only buy take and bake pizzas from Costco, or Bi-Lo Your total value for pizzas in a month is shown below

</ul>
<li>
When making incremental decisions, rational people don't think about total costs and benefits. They care about marginal costs and benefits

<li>
Marginal decisions occur in the moment:

<ul>
<li>
Prior decisions should be taken as given when considering new decisions

</ul>
<li>
Large decisions can be marginal if they are binary:

<ul>
<li>
Example

<ul>
<li>
Buying a house or not

<li>
Going to class

<li>
Proposing to SO

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
If you play video games for an hour tonight rather than studying, do you value video games more than studying?

<li>
NO, Because you probably only value playing video games more on the margin but not necessary in total

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Exam 1-1&#47;24&#47;17-Wealth"><h3 id="Wealth">Wealth</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Why do we care about it

<li>
Police officer v. Teacher

<ul>
<li>
Typically both are around $50k

<li>
Why would a police officer make more after retirement:

<ul>
<li>
Because they have more exposure to valuable goods (criminal activity)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Exam 1-1&#47;24&#47;17-The Power of Trade"><h3 id="The Power of Trade">The Power of Trade</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Quantifying the benefits of trade:

<ul>
<li>
Consumer Surplus = WTP(MB) - Price:

<ul>
<li>
Willingness to pay

</ul>
<li>
Producer Surplus = Price - Opportunity Cost(MC)

<li>
Gains from trade = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus

<li>
Activity:

<ul>
<li>
1:

<ul>
<li>
14:

</ul>
<li>
Sold for 25

<li>
Cost to build was 14

<li>
Producer Surplus = 11

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Money and trade

<ul>
<li>
To make trade easier, people use money:

<li>
Trade happens in nearly every aspect of life

<ul>
<li>
A waitress buys a coke from a vending machine is an example of trade

<li>
Right this second:

<ul>
<li>
You pay the school money and they in return pay a teacher who then teaches you a topic

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Wealth of societies is maximized when people are allowed to specialize and trade

<li>
Absolute Advantage:

<ul>
<li>
Is when an individual/country can produce a good using fewer resources

<li>
Who ever can produce more of a good in a time frame will have the absolute advantage

</ul>
<li>
Comparative Advantage:

<ul>
<li>
Is when an individual/country can produce a good at lower opportunity cost

<li>
To find who has the comparative advantage you must calculate opportunity cost for each producer

<li>
You cannot have the comparative advantage in all goods

<li>
The Law of Comparative Advantage:

<ul>
<li>
People and countries should specialize in what they have a comparative advantage in and then trade for other goods

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
Snoop dog 

<ul>
<li>
can produce 12 bottles of gin

<li>
36 bottles of juice

<li>
Or any linear combo of the two

</ul>
<li>
Snoop Lion:

<ul>
<li>
con produce 10 bottles of gin

<li>
can produce 5 bottles of juice

</ul>
<li>
Absolute advantage:

<ul>
<li>
Snoop dog has the absolute advantage in both juice and gin because given the time frame he can produce more of each 

</ul>
<li>
Comparative advantage:

<ul>
<li>
Snoop dog:

<ul>
<li>
OC of 1gin = 36juice/12gin = 3juice per bottle of gin

<li>
OC of 1juice = 12gin/36juice = 1/3 bottle of gin per juice **

</ul>
<li>
Snoop Lion:

<ul>
<li>
OC of 1gin = 5juice/10gin = 1/2juice per bottle of gin **

<li>
OC of 1juice = 10gin/5juice= 2 bottles of gin per juice

</ul>
<li>
Snoop Lion has the comparative advantage in Gin because he gives up production of less juice per bottle of gin therefore Snoop Lion should make Gin **

<li>
Snoop Dog has the comparative advantage in Juice because he gives up production of less gin per bottle of juice therefore Snoop Dog should make Juice **

</ul>
<li>
In Trade:

<ul>
<li>
The MOST Dog will pay for gin in 3 juices because any more than that and it would be better for him to make it

<li>
The MOST Lion will pay for juice is 2 Gin because any more than that and it would be better for him to make it

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
PPF:

<ul>
<li>
Production possibility frontier is a graphical representation of the combination of goods that an individual/country can produce given limited resources

<li>
If you are producing on the line between two points you are producing "efficiently"

<ul>
<li>
1.5 trucks - if the us charged more they would make it themselves-it would be cheaper to do so

Trucks:

<ul>
<li>

</ul>
 
<ul>
<li>
What would happen if terms of trade were set at 1 airplane for .75 trucks ( this is equivalent to 1 truck for 1.33 airplanes )

<ul>
<li>
The US sells airplanes to Mexico. They trade 1 airplane for .75 trucks

<li>
The US is selling at their opportunity cost - Mexico gets all of the gains from trade. The US is no better or worse off than before

Kelly and john are stranded on an island. There are two sources of food - coconuts and fish. Will trade make them better off?

<ul>
<li>
Kelly is better than john at collecting coconuts and john is better coconuts will trade make them better:

<ul>
<li>
Yes

</ul>
<li>
Both Kelly and john are better at fishing than collecting coconuts:

<ul>
<li>
Yes (Almost always), only if opportunities costs are set up right

</ul>
<li>
Kelly is better at everything:

<ul>
<li>
Trade will still be beneficial in almost all cases if the opportunity costs line up.

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
If opportunity costs are the same then nobody will benefit from trading

<li>
Trade does have losers:

<li>
If you buy a motorcycle for 1000$ and then discover you do not like riding it the best thing to do is to sell the motorcycle for the best offer you can get This if because the marginal benefit you get from each ride is 0 dollars and therefore MB&lt;MC

<li>
You buy a 50$ all day ski pass and you plan on taking 10 runs to get 100 dollars of enjoyment. After four runs you are not enjoying it anymore and want to go home. Then you should go home because your MB is 0 and is less then the marginal cost of the next run

<li>
Trade makes people better because:

<ol>
<li>
Its voluntary

<li>
People wouldn't engage in it otherwise

<li>
It only occurs when there is potential for gains

<li>
All of the above ***

</ol>
<li>
You miss the last train home on New years eve after walking for an hour you spot a taxi, its driver wants 150 to take you home. The route usually costs 30.

<ol>
<li>
The deal has made you better off and the driver worse off

<li>
The deal has made you worse off and the driver better off

<li>
The deal has made you both better off ***

<li>
The deal has made you both worse off

<li>
Made the driver better off but your situation unchanged

<li>
Only make a trade if you are both better off because of it

<div id="Exam 1-Exam Review-Marginal Decisions"><h3 id="Marginal Decisions">Marginal Decisions</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Rational people always make decisions on the margin

<li>
Marginal analysis:

<ul>
<li>
Use marginal benefit and marginal cost to decide how much to consume/purchase

<li>
Marginal means "another"

<li>
Marginal benefit - the increase in the total benefit from one unit to the next

<li>
Marginal cost - The increase in total cost from one unit to the next, if you are buying something that has a constant price the price is the marginal cost

</ul>
<li>
Only consume if your marginal benefit is at lease as much as the cost

<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
Also called the market clearing price

<li>
Out of equilibrium surplus

<li>
Surplus:

<ul>
<li>
The quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded 

</ul>
<li>
Price:

<ul>
<li>
If there is a surplus producers will raise the price (if they legally can) until a equilibrium is met

<li>
If there is a shortage consumers will raise the price (if they legally can) until a equilibrium is met

</ul>
<li>
Equilibrium price - price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied:

<ul>
<li>
this price maximises gains from trade

<li>
this price allocates good to those who values them most

</ul>
<li>
Supply curve, can also be thought of as the opportunity cost curve

<ul>
<li>
Why are diamonds that are practically functionally useless where as water is much more useful (survival)

<li>
Because the marginal value is where the total value lies

States in the Midwest experience a favorable weather pattern, Meanwhile the gluten free trend spikes. What is the effect on price and quantity in the market for wheat

<ul>
<li>
For the favorable weather pattern:

<ul>
<li>
Supply increases

<li>
Price decreases

<li>
Quantity increases

</ul>
<li>
For the gluten free movement

<ul>
<li>
Demand decreases

<li>
Price decreases

<li>
Quantity decreases

</ul>
<li>
Since price decreases due to both effects the price will decrease overall, but since quantity increases and decreases we don't know the total affect of either overall

</ul>

<div id="Exam 2-2&#47;28&#47;17-Elasticity"><h3 id="Elasticity">Elasticity</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Two types:

<ul>
<li>
Demand elasticity:

<ul>
<li>
Is not equal to the slope of the demand curve

<li>
Don't use the midpoint method

<li>
Elasticity:

</ul>
<li>
Supply elasticity
<pre>
                Price(D')
Elasticity =----------------- 
            %change in price
            
Elasticity = 1/slope * P/Q
</pre>

</ul>
<li>
If elasticity is equal to 1 then it is called "unit elastic"

<li>
Inelastic demand:

<ul>
<li>
The quantity response is small compared to the change in price

<li>
Steeper slopes

</ul>
<li>
Elastic:

<ul>
<li>
The quantity response is large compared to the change in price

<li>
flatter slopes

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Exam 2-2&#47;28&#47;17-Determinants of elasticity"><h3 id="Determinants of elasticity">Determinants of elasticity</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Number of substitutes an item has makes it more elastic:

<ul>
<li>
If coke and Pepsi are the same in your mind and are the exact same price:

<ul>
<li>
If they raise the price of coke:

<ul>
<li>
You will buy Pepsi

</ul>
<li>
You would be very responsive to the increase or decrease in price of one or the other

</ul>
<li>
The more substitutes something has the more responsive you will be to price changes (steeper slopes)

</ul>
<li>
Necessity/non-necessity

<ul>
<li>
Have a more inelastic demand curve

<li>
Non-necessity (luxury) goods will have a more inelastic curve

</ul>
<li>
Demand for drugs tend to be inelastic:

<ul>
<li>
They do not have close substitutes since many drugs are patented

<li>
They are also necessities to those who are using them for treatment

</ul>
<li>
Time periods

<ul>
<li>
Short term: Less elastic (more inelastic):

<ul>
<li>
Less time to figure out other options

</ul>
<li>
Long term: More elastic:

<ul>
<li>
More time to figure out other options

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Good classifications

<li>
Budget Share:

<ul>
<li>
What percentage of your total income do you spend on a good:

<ul>
<li>
Small part:

<ul>
<li>
Less elastic 

</ul>
<li>
Large part:

<ul>
<li>
More elastic

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Price of bread increases:

<ul>
<li>
Low  income households will reduce their consumption of bread by a greater percentage than high income households based on price fluctuation

</ul>
<li>
Less responsive to price changes when the good is a small part of your budget

</ul>
<li>
Perfect inelastic goods:

<ul>
<li>
No matter the price you will buy the same quantity

<li>
Strait up and down line

<li>
No substitutes

</ul>
<li>
Perfect elastic

<ul>
<li>
Infinitely many substitutes

<li>
Horizontal line (no slope)

</ul>
