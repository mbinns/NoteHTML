</ul>
<li>
Product leadership:

<ul>
<li>
Rolex

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Risk management:

<ul>
<li>
Every strategy has a risk

<li>
This is the process of anticipating the risks and control the risk or mitigate the impact to processes

</ul>
<li>
Corperate social responsibility:

<ul>
<li>
When making a decision you need to take into account the needs of all the stakeholders and how a decision would impact them

</ul>
<li>
Process management:

<ul>
<li>
A business process is a series of steps that are folowed in order to carry out some task

<li>
Assembly line is a good example because is addes value in the form of uniformity and a streamlined process

<li>
Value chain is used to describe how an organization functional departments interact with one another

<li>
JIT (Just in time production) dont make the product untill you get the order

<li>
LEAN+ and ITIL Processes

</ul>
<li>
Leadership perspective:

<ul>
<li>
Intrinsitc motivation:

<ul>
<li>
Something within themselves that motivates them

</ul>
<li>
Extrinsic motivation:

<ul>
<li>
External motivation factors

</ul>
<li>
Cognitive Bias:

<ul>
<li>
You have a belief and things that are not consitant with your beleifs you tend to avoid

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
The numbers matter even though there are no rules because the internal decision makers cannot make a well informed decision

<li>
Some companies will give up the bottom line to meet the perspectives they outline:

<ul>
<li>
They will not cut too much profit otherwise they would go out of business

</ul>
</ul>

Cost classifications:

<ul>
<li>
Assigning costs to cost objects:

<ul>
<li>
These are groupings of costs that are similar in origin

</ul>
<li>
Account for costs in manufacturing companies

<ul>
<li>
What ever you are making is a cost object

</ul>
<li>
Cost objects:

<ul>
<li>
Could be the dept of the company

<li>
The division of the company

<li>
Some cost objects can be a direct cost to one object and <span id="ACCT 2020-Chapter 2-8&#47;22&#47;16-also"></span><strong id="also">also</strong> an indirect cost to another object

<li>
Anything you want to cost (Product/Service)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Manufacturing company examples

<ul>
<li>
3 types of inventory:

<ul>
<li>
Raw materials:

<ul>
<li>
Just because it is a raw material does not mean it is not a finished good:

<ul>
<li>
For a tire company a tire is a finished good

<li>
For a car company a tire is a raw material

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Work-in-Process/Progress:

<ul>
<li>
Traditional production lines are a good example of this

<ul>
<li>
Traditional - things at the start are raw materials and things at the end is a finished product

<li>
Anything inbetween the start and the end is a work in progress

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Finished goods:

<ul>
<li>
Anything that is ready to be sold for that particular company

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Financial statement preperation:

<ul>
<li>
Internally prepared using contribution format:

<ul>
<li>
If you produce more than what you are selling then your net income will go down because it is reported as an expense

</ul>
<li>
Externally prepared using absorbtion/full:

<ul>
<li>
You can predict net income by predicting production compared to sales

<ul>
<li>
You can increase net income by producing more than you sell because it is reported as an asset

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Predicting Cost Behavior:

<ul>
<li>
Cost behaviors are looked at in straight line replationships in managerial accounting

<li>
In a fixed range (Called relavent range) the costs are "fixed" meaning that they are in a straight line 

</ul>
<li>
Making decisions:

<ul>
<li>
Should you increase company size

<li>
Should you decrease

<li>
Should you remove a product or make more of them

</ul>
<li>
Cost objects:

<ul>
<li>
Direct costs are a cost that can be easily and conveniently tracked to a source (Cost object):

<ul>
<li>
Example: A cost object is widget the people who are making the widgets salary is a direct cost

</ul>
<li>
Indirect cost is the inverse of direct cost where is cannot be traced to a specific cost object:

<ul>
<li>
Example: The supervisor for the people making the widget is an indirect cost

<li>
Example: if the widgets are being charged to the department then the workers salary is still a direct cost of the widget, but now the supervisors salary is now also a direct cost

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Categories of Cost objects:

<ul>
<li>
Manufacturing costs:

<ul>
<li>
Raw materials:

<ul>
<li>
Direct cost

</ul>
<li>
Direct labor:

<ul>
<li>
Direct cost

</ul>
<li>
Manufacturing overhead:

<ul>
<li>
Indirect cost because you don't know how to distribute the cost of a building to each production piece

<li>
If it involves the making of the product then it falls under this:

<ul>
<li>
Example: Supervisor of workers in the factory falls in this category

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Prime costs:

<ul>
<li>
Cost of direct materials + direct labor

</ul>
<li>
Conversion Cost:

<ul>
<li>
Direct labor cost + manufacturing overhead

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Nonmanufacturing costs:

<ul>
<li>
Selling costs:

<ul>
<li>
Order getting and order filling:

<ul>
<li>
Paying sales person commision

<li>
Pay shipping to customer

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Administrative costs:

<ul>
<li>
Paying the accountant

<li>
Does not involve the making of the product:

<ul>
<li>
Example: Supervisor for accountants falls under this

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Cost classifications:

<ul>
<li>
Product Costs:

<ul>
<li>
Inventoriable costs

<li>
The costs are then then expensed as the goods are sold (Cost of goods sold):

<ul>
<li>
Matching principle: Record the expense at the same time period you record the revenue

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Period Costs:

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Predicting cost behavior:

<ul>
<li>
Saying costs are linear is okay within a relevant range (Fixed cost)

<li>
Difference between fixed cost and variable cost is total variable cost

<li>
Total cost is total variable cost + fixed cost

<li>
Three categories

<ul>
<li>
Variable

<ul>
<li>
Total variable cost:

<ul>
<li>
Linear relationship

</ul>
<li>
Varies in direct proportion to changes in the level of activity

<li>
Variable cost per unit is constant

<li>
Cost drivers is a measure of whatever causes the incurrence of a variable cost

</ul>
<li>
Fixed:

<ul>
<li>
Remains constant in total regardless of changes in the level of activity

<li>
Example: Manufacturing facility that produces 10,000 widgets and property taxes are 2000$ property taxes are a fixed cost because it does not matter how much you produce the property taxes stay 2000

<li>
The more you produce the lower the fixed cost per unit, fixed cost/units:

<ul>
<li>
2000/10,000 widgets = .20cents a unit

</ul>
<li>
Types:

<ul>
<li>
Committed:

<ul>
<li>
Typically cannot reduce or cut out these costs without doing harm to the company:

<ul>
<li>
Example: Cutting back on research and development, in the short term it may be okay but it will set you back for the long run

<li>
Example: Stopping production on a product

</ul>
<li>
Multiyear planning horizon, has long term effects

</ul>
<li>
Discretionary:

<ul>
<li>
You can often reduce the ammounts or even eliminate them with out doing harm to the company:

<ul>
<li>
Example of a fixed cost would be the advertising budget

</ul>
<li>
These are typically things that are voluntary for the company

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Mixed:

<ul>
<li>
Cost containing both mixed and varibale costs:

<ul>
<li>
Example: Renting a car with a cost per day and a charge per mile:

<ul>
<li>
The cost per day is fixed

<li>
The cost per mile is variable

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Need to seperate the fixed portion from the variable portion because you want everything to fall into the fixed or variable categories

<li>
How to break them appart:

<ul>
<li>
Account analysis

<li>
Engineering approach

<li>
High-low method:

<ul>
<li>

<li>
Steps

<ul>
<li>
Look for a trend

<ul>
<li>
Scatterplot:

<ul>
<li>
Dependent variable (Costs)

<li>
Independent variable (Activity)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Identify extreme outliers and see what they do to your data with and without it

</ul>
<li>
Variable Cost:
<pre>
Simple example:
Change in Cost
---------------
Change in Activity

Verbose example:
(Cost1 - Cost2)
---------------
((Activity1 - Activity2)

All of those numbers are generated from just two datapoints
</pre>

<li>
You only use two data points out of your dataset:

<ul>
<li>
Take the lowest level of activity:

<ul>
<li>
Calculate cost of this data point

</ul>
<li>
Take the highest level of activity:

<ul>
<li>
Calculate cost of this data point

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Fixed Cost

<li>
Total Costs = Fixed Cost + Total Variable Cost

</ul>
<li>
Least-squares regression analysis:

<ul>
<li>
Don't worry about this for the class (But know it exists)

<li>
Y = a + bX

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Step-costs:

<ul>
<li>
Step-fixed costs:

<ul>
<li>
Example: a manufacturing facility that produces 10,000 units wants to produce 16,000 units they need to expand the building which would cost 1,000,000 dollars everything after 10,000 units has another 1,000,000 added to the fixed cost

</ul>
<li>
Step-variable costs:

<ul>
<li>
Employees with variable production

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>

Cost classification for decision making:

<ul>
<li>
Oppertunity cost:

<ul>
<li>
What you have given up to do an alternative action

</ul>
<li>
Difference cost/incremental:

<ul>
<li>
The difference in cost between two methods or in a change of output levels

</ul>
<li>
Sunk cost:

<ul>
<li>
Cost that has already been incurred and cannot be changed in anyway

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed Cost Review:

<ul>
<li>
There is a range, within that relevant range the fixed cost does not change

<li>
Example: Suppose a fixed cost is 100,000$ for all production from 0 to 1000 units. If you produce 0 units it is 100,000 if you produce 1000 units its still 100,000. you cannot produce more than 1000 without fist stepping up the fixed cost using the step method described above.

<li>
Average fixed cost is the average cost per unit, it goes down ans prodction goes up

<ul>
<li>
Example (Using above numbers): if you make 1 unit the Avgfixed cost is 100,000 if you prodruce 100 units the average fixed cost is 1000 per unit. If you produce 1000 units the average fixed cost per unit is 100.

</ul>

How profits are afected by:

<ul>
<li>
Selling prices

<li>
Sales volume

<li>
Unit Variable cost/expense

<li>
Total fixed cost/expense

<li>
Mixed of products sold

</ul>
<li>
Assumptions are:

<ul>
<li>
Selling price is constant

<li>
Costs are linear and can be accurately divided into variable and fixed elements

<li>
In multi product companies the mix of products sold remains constant

What is left over after variable expenses have been deducted

<li>
Break even is the level at which profit is zero

</ul>

Equations:
<pre>
Profit = (sales - variable expenses) - fixed income
Sales = Selling price per unit * #sold
Variable expenses = Variable expense per unit * #sold
