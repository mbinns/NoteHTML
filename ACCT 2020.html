Cost classifications:

<ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
These are groupings of costs that are similar in origin

</ul>
<li>
Account for costs in manufacturing companies

<ul>
<li>
What ever you are making is a cost object

</ul>
<li>
Cost objects:

<ul>
<li>
Could be the dept of the company

<li>
The division of the company

<li>
Some cost objects can be a direct cost to one object and <span id="ACCT 2020-8&#47;22&#47;16-also"></span><strong id="also">also</strong> an indirect cost to another object

<li>
Anything you want to cost (Product/Service)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Manufacturing company examples

<ul>
<li>
3 types of inventory:

<ul>
<li>
Raw materials:

<ul>
<li>
Just because it is a raw material does not mean it is not a finished good:

<ul>
<li>
For a tire company a tire is a finished good

<li>
For a car company a tire is a raw material

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Work-in-Process/Progress:

<ul>
<li>
Traditional production lines are a good example of this

<ul>
<li>
Traditional - things at the start are raw materials and things at the end is a finished product

<li>
Anything inbetween the start and the end is a work in progress

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Finished goods:

<ul>
<li>
Anything that is ready to be sold for that particular company

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Financial statement preperation:

<ul>
<li>
Internally prepared using contribution format:

<ul>
<li>
If you produce more than what you are selling then your net income will go down because it is reported as an expense

</ul>
<li>
Externally prepared using absorbtion/full:

<ul>
<li>
You can predict net income by predicting production compared to sales

<ul>
<li>
You can increase net income by producing more than you sell because it is reported as an asset

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Predicting Cost Behavior:

<ul>
<li>
Cost behaviors are looked at in straight line replationships in managerial accounting

<li>
In a fixed range (Called relavent range) the costs are "fixed" meaning that they are in a straight line 

</ul>
<li>
Making decisions:

<ul>
<li>
Should you increase company size

<li>
Should you decrease

<li>
Should you remove a product or make more of them

</ul>
<li>
Cost objects:

<ul>
<li>
Direct costs are a cost that can be easily and conveniently tracked to a source (Cost object):

<ul>
<li>
Example: A cost object is widget the people who are making the widgets salary is a direct cost

</ul>
<li>
Indirect cost is the inverse of direct cost where is cannot be traced to a specific cost object:

<ul>
<li>
Example: The supervisor for the people making the widget is an indirect cost

<li>
Example: if the widgets are being charged to the department then the workers salary is still a direct cost of the widget, but now the supervisors salary is now also a direct cost

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Categories of Cost objects:

<ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
Direct cost

</ul>
<li>

<li>

</ul>
<li>
Manufacturing overhead:

<ul>
<li>
Indirect cost because you don't know how to distribute the cost of a building to each production piece

<li>
If it involves the making of the product then it falls under this:

<ul>
<li>
Example: Supervisor of workers in the factory falls in this category

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Prime costs:

<ul>
<li>
Cost of direct materials + direct labor

</ul>
<li>
Conversion Cost:

<ul>
<li>
