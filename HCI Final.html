<p>
This is just going to be a mashup of all of my notes and those that seem relevant to the final exam. Sorry if it is hard to follow this is more for my use.
</p>

<div id="Memory and Processing"><h3 id="Memory and Processing">Memory and Processing</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Memory:

<ul>
<li>
Encoding - What do you pay attention to, what do you ignore

<li>
Processing - Making sense of the information that has been encoded

<li>
Context - The senario in which the memory is stored

<li>
Remembering - Good with emotions, faces, and smells

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Fonts"><h3 id="Fonts">Fonts</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Cardinal sin is the "<span id="Fonts-Click here"></span><strong id="Click here">Click here</strong>" format

<li>
Use high contrast colors, non-adjacent on a color wheel

<li>
Red-green color blindness

<li>
Easy to read text: size, font, style:

<ul>
<li>
Style:

<ul>
<li>
Serif- Better for printed media, has wings

<li>
Sans-Serif - Better for digital reading no wings

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Prototyping"><h3 id="Prototyping">Prototyping</h3></div>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>
Determine user needs

<li>
Create use scenarios

<li>
Facilitate user goals

</ul>
<li>
Persona:

<ul>

</ul>
<li>
HTA (Hierarchial task analysys)

<li>
Participatory Design

<li>
Tool Spectrum:

<ul>
<li>

<li>
Balsamiq

<li>
Powerpoint

<li>
Invision

<li>
Why:

<ul>
<li>
Quick itterations

<li>
Compare solutions

<li>
Generate feedback

</ul>
</ul>
<li>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Usability Testing"><h3 id="Usability Testing">Usability Testing</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
The extent in which a product can be used efficently and satisfaction in a specified context of use

<li>
Never test the user, only the product

<li>
Formative is durring development and summative is at the end of development

<li>
Usability Lab is the old school way to do it, it looks like an interrogation room

<li>
Difference between usability evaluaton and testing:

<ul>
<li>
Evaluation is when experts look at the system

<li>
Testing is when users are brought into the system

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Cognative walkthrough"><h3 id="Cognative walkthrough">Cognative walkthrough</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
An inspection method for evaluating the design of a user interface with special attention to how well the interface supprts exploratory learning. The eval us done by having a group of evaluators step through commonly used tasks. It can be preformed early in the design phase before preformance testing is possible

<li>
This is where experts are doing the test and you are not describing feelings

<li>
Trying to get into the midset of the novice users

<li>
You are trying to identify where users may get off task (Similar to thinkaloud)

<li>
Methods of a walkthrough:

<ul>
<li>
Inspection method:

<ul>
<li>
Have experts inspect a perticular interface or protype

<li>
Can be preformed in the early stages of design:

<ul>
<li>
You get the most bang from your buck by doing this method

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Ask specific questions as we stip through the interface:

<ul>
<li>
Will users be trying to produce whatever effect a particular action has

<li>
Will users notice a corrct action is visible

<li>
Will the user associate the correct action with the effect to be achived

<li>
Will users understand feedback fter an action

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
These are really well suutied to first time users doing exploaratory learning with out any formal training. you are trying to imagine what a novice user might encounter when using a system

<li>
Requirements:

<ul>
<li>
Who

<li>
What

<li>
Action sequence

<li>
Description of implementation of the interface

<li>
Usability experts, 3-4 is the ideal number

</ul>
<li>
Assumptions:

<ul>
<li>
A user may have some similar cutural background so that they would be familiar with a particular metaphore

<li>
Similar physical abilities

<li>
The user should have a goal defined

<li>
The user will explore

<li>
The users are going to choose somethong that seems reasonable

<li>
The user is able to interpret the response form the system correctly

</ul>
<li>
Process:

<ul>
<li>
Finding some collegues to participate in it with you

<li>
Define some tasks

<li>
Define the sequence of actions that ideally would allow users to accomplesh a particular goal

<li>
Take notes and keep track of things noted

<li>
Analyse data

</ul>
<li>
Methodology:

<ul>
<li>
As a walkthrough is being conducted recored you assumptions

<li>
Notes about side issues and design changes

<li>
Summary of results

<li>
Alter design to attempt to fix the problems noticed

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Thinkaloud"><h3 id="Thinkaloud">Thinkaloud</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Describe your feelings about the interface

<li>
why they are preforming the actions they are

<li>
Novice users

<li>
Trying to find where they are going to get off task (Similar to congnative)

</ul>

<div id="Documentation"><h3 id="Documentation">Documentation</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Can be useful for users, yourself, and people who may look at your code in the future

<li>
What is documentation:

<ul>
<li>
Paper manuals, man pages, anything that provides information on the system

</ul>
<li>
User support:

<ul>
<li>
Help - problem specific

<li>
Documentation - general and system wide

</ul>
<li>
Help and Doc:

<ul>
<li>
Essential, but never a replacement for bad design

<li>
Most systems with reach features will require documentation

</ul>
<li>
Manuals:

<ul>
<li>
Cons:

<ul>
<li>
Can be lost

<li>
Lots of irrelevant info

<li>
Takes up space

<li>
<span id="Documentation-USERS DONT READ"></span><strong id="USERS DONT READ">USERS DONT READ</strong>

</ul>
<li>
Can be included on the device

</ul>
<li>
Support requirements:

<ul>
<li>
Availability:

<ul>
<li>
Any time the users is at a system

</ul>
<li>
Accurate and complete

<li>
Consistancy

<li>

</ul>
<li>
Flexable

<li>
Unobtrusive

</ul>
<li>
Tutorials:

<ul>
<li>
Can provide a good conceptual model for how a system works

<li>
Convey the essential items that the users have to know in order to operate the system

<li>
essential interaction patterns that the user may have never seen before

</ul>
<li>
Quick reference:

<ul>
<li>
Like a cheet sheet

<li>
Good for experienced users

</ul>
<li>
Context sensitive help:
