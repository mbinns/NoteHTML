<pre>
If National Beverage reissues 5,000 shares of this treasury stock for $28 per share (5,000 Ã— $28 = $140,000), the accounting equation effects and journal entry would be:
Journal Entry:
-------------------
dr. Cash                        $140,000
    cr. Treasury Stock                   $125,000
    cr. Additional Pain in Capital       $15,000
    
If treasury stock were reissued at a price below its repurchase price, the difference between the repurchase price ($25 per share) and the reissue price (say, $23 per share) is recorded as a reduction in Additional Paid-in Capital. The accounting equation effects and journal entry for reissuing at an amount less than its cost are:
Journal Entry:

dr. Cash                        $115,000
