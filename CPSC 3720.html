<li>
Gives a couple of classes and asks how many ways a class is coupled

</ul>
<li>
Layer Architecture

<div id="CPSC 3720-Lecture 3&#47;8&#47;16-Capability Maturity Model: CMM"><h3 id="Capability Maturity Model: CMM">Capability Maturity Model: CMM</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Defines the levels of maturity for a software development org

<li>
Developed by software engineering institute

<ul>
<li>
U.S defense dept.

</ul>
<li>
Originally used to assess ability of government contractors to develop software

<li>
Levels rate the effectiveness of an orgs management

<ul>
<li>
Level 1: Initial (Chaos)

<ul>
<li>
Processes are chaotic, unrepeatable, undocumented

<li>
Orgs at this level can produce working software

<ul>
<li>
Often exceeds budget and schedule

<li>
Successes often due to heroic efforts

</ul>
<li>
Difficulty repeating past success

</ul>
<li>
Level 2: Repeatable

<ul>
<li>
Some aspects of processes are documented

<li>
Basic project management inplace

<li>
Organization can usually repeat success on projects similar in scope and domain to past efforts

</ul>
<li>
Level 3: Defined

<ul>
<li>
Software development processes are standardized and defined

<ul>
<li>
Not just common in the head knowledge

</ul>
<li>
Processes are improved over time

<ul>
<li>
Will take time to assess what went well and what did not, then adjust the process to do better

</ul>
<li>
Reviews are typically signed off on

</ul>
<li>
Level 4: Managed

<ul>
<li>
Management can control software development using quantitative techniques

<ul>
<li>
Counting bugs, customer change revirews, etc.

</ul>
<li>
Focus on gathering metrics and using them to make estimates for future projects

<li>
Processes are predictable

<li>
Orgs are much more likely to meet time / budget estimates

<ul>
<li>
Using the quantitative estimates

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Level 5: Optimizing

<ul>
<li>
Focus on improving the software development process using metrics

<ul>
<li>
Looking at the number of change requests generated for the projects they are working on and working to lower the numbers

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Durring interviews:

<ul>
<li>
Ask what type of process they follow

<li>
You can usually determine where the org stands by the response

<li>
Ask about project post-mortums to see if there is process improvement

</ul>
</ul>

Can refer to:

<li>
A set of activities designed to ensure software quality

<li>
A department in a software development orgs

<li>
Validation:

<ul>
<li>
Are we building the right product

<li>
Focused on customer reqs

<li>
Collaborative activity: Customer is involved

<li>
Activity: Testing

</ul>
<li>

<div id="Exam 3 Material-Lecture 3&#47;31&#47;2016-Verification"><h3 id="Verification">Verification</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Three activities typically used:

<ul>
<li>
Testing:

<ul>
<li>
Execute program to check for bugs

<li>
Finds about 60-70% of the bugs in the code, it is impossible to find all of the bugs

</ul>
<li>
Tracing:

<ul>
<li>
Review source code to check for bugs

<li>
More eyeballs to check for more bugs

</ul>
<li>
Formal Verification:

<ul>
<li>
Prove source code correctly implements its spec

<li>
Most comprehensive checking and will find all of the bugs in the code, if the proof is correct

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Combo of Testing and Tracing is the best way to find most bugs

</ul>

<li>
QA representatives paticipate in development process from start to finish

<li>
Effecting bug squashing involves collaborative processes between dev and QA

</ul>

<div id="Exam 3 Material-Lecture 3&#47;31&#47;2016-Testing"><h3 id="Testing">Testing</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Addresses the ultimate question: "Does it work?"

<li>
Mindsets:

<ul>
<li>
Test to show that the program meets reqs:

<ul>
<li>
This is wrong because there is not a program that does not have bugs

</ul>
<li>
Test to find bugs:

<ul>
<li>
This is the correct mindset when going into testing

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
A successful test is a test that uncovers a bug 

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
White box:

<ul>
<li>
Internal perspective

<li>
Select input based on knowledge of implementation details

<li>
Debugger

<li>
Advantages:

<ul>
<li>
Finds more bugs becuase you can design input that takes into account the design of the code

<li>
Finds the bugs that does not find the correct answer using the correct way, even if it find the right answer

<li>
More comprehensive

<li>
Can be done sooner

</ul>
<li>
Disadvantage:

<ul>
<li>
Must be done after the fact/can not be off loaded

<li>
More expensive

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Black box:

<ul>
<li>
External perspective

<li>
Does not use knowledge of implementation details

<li>
Feed in input observe output

<li>
Advantage:

<ul>
<li>
Testing can be created in parrallel with the dev of the program if they have been included in the initial spec sheet convo

<li>
More through because they have a testing mindset

</ul>
<li>
Disadvantage:

<ul>
<li>
Cannot find the bugs were the output is correct but the method was wrong

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Devs can do both black and white box

<li>
QA just does Black box

isolates the component and feeds it input to make sure it performs correctly

</ul>
<li>
Integration testing:

<ul>
<li>
integrates the component into the system to make sure it performs correctly in a full environment

<li>
Testing parts of the whole system in a combined component environ

<li>
Can be automated

</ul>
<li>
Validation testing:

<ul>
<li>
Does it have the right features

<li>
Does it meet the specs

<li>
Running the whole system

<li>
More comprehensive that intergration testing

<li>
Never automated

</ul>
<li>
Regression test:

<ul>
<li>
Checks whether code modifications introduced bugs that were not present in the previous build

<li>
Done be QA

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Agile QA Testing

<li>
Test driven dev:

<ul>
<li>
Kkey agile dev technique

<li>
Write unit test before implementing functionality

<li>
Process (In Order):

<ul>
<li>
Write spec for new method to be implemented

<li>
Create stub method (Empty)

<li>
Create unit test for method

<li>
Run test (obsureve failures)

<li>
Implement method

<li>
Run unit test

<li>
Degub if fails

</ul>
<li>
Advantages:

<ul>
<li>
Helps write the spec for the method percisely

<li>
Looks at the corner cases first

<li>
Gives you away to step through your code as soon as you have written it

<li>
Find more bugs

<li>
Psychologically motivating

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Exam 3 Material-Lecture 3&#47;31&#47;2016-Test Case Design"><h3 id="Test Case Design">Test Case Design</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Consits of two things:

<ul>
<li>
Input data

<li>
Expected results

</ul>
<li>
Smallest number of cases that have the highest probablity of crashing the program

<li>
Approaches:

<ul>
<li>
Specification based approach: (Black Box)

<ul>
<li>
Design test inputs that conform to precondition

<li>
Compute expected results

</ul>
<li>
Implementation based approach: (White Box)

</ul>

<li>
Quiz on Thusday 4/07/16:

<ul>
<li>
Given code be prepared to do a proof of correctness

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Exam 3 Material-Lecture 4&#47;05&#47;16-Formal Verification"><h3 id="Formal Verification">Formal Verification</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Proof of correctness of code

<li>
Assuming preconditions are met, proof demonstrates that the code ensures that the postconditions are met

<li>
What if precondidtions are not met:

<ul>
<li>
Example, invalid parameters

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Exam 3 Material-Lecture 4&#47;05&#47;16-Automated Formal Verification"><h3 id="Automated Formal Verification">Automated Formal Verification</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Holy grail of verification research:

<ul>
<li>
Given code and specs, automatically prove that code meets specs

</ul>
<li>
Requirements:

<ul>
<li>
Specs must be written formally

</ul>
<li>
Approaches:

<ul>
<li>
Add annotaions to existing programming languages

<li>
Desgn <em>verifiable</em> programming languages

</ul>

Table Style:
Initial Facts come from the pre conditions of the preconditions of the code you are given
In RESOLVE this is the "Requires" clause
Initial facts have a state number to specifiy what state of your var you are refering to

Obligations come from the post conditions of the function and preconditions of individual
states of the program
In RESOLVE restores can specify a post condition, ensures can also do this

|   | Facts         | Obligations     |
|---|---------------|-----------------|
| 0 | I0+1&lt;=max_int | 1+I0 &lt;=max_int  |
|---|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | I1=I0+1       | min_int &lt;= I1-1 |
|---|---------------|-----------------|
| 2 | I2=I1-1       | I2=I0           |

Substitution can be preformed to show that I2=I0
I2=I1-1
I1=I0+1
Therefore
I2=I0+1-1
I2=I0
