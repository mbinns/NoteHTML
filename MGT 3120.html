Grading is divided into schemes

First quiz is next Friday

<div id="Decision Modeling-3 Parts"><h2 id="3 Parts">3 Parts</h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Must get step one correct before you have the ability to get the other two steps correct because they both depend on the DV variable

<li>
If you are not using what you used in step one in step 2 and 3 then what  you have in step 1 is wrong

<li>
Decision Variables (DVs):

<ul>
<li>
Represent the decisions to be made

<li>
Question to ask yourself

<ul>
<li>
"What do I need to know"

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Objective Function(OF):

<ul>
<li>
Measure of performance in terms of DVs

<li>
Question to ask yourself

<ul>
<li>
"Why are we solving this problem"

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Constraints:

<ul>
<li>
Express restrictions on the values that can be assigned to the DVs

<li>
Question to ask yourself

<ul>
<li>
"What restrictions must we work under"

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Decision Modeling-Linear Programming (LP)"><h2 id="Linear Programming (LP)">Linear Programming (LP)</h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Type of decision model

<li>
Characteristics:

<ul>
<li>
Must be a decision to be made

<li>
DVs can take on any values*

<ul>
<li>
Constraints express the restrictions on the values that can be assigned to the DVs

</ul>
<li>
OF either minimizes or maximizes the measure of performance 

<li>
OF and Constraints must be linear in form:

<ul>
<li>
Example) X+Y&lt;=100

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
invalid linear examples:

<ul>
<li>
No exponents

<li>
No multiplication of variables:

<ul>
<li>
Constants can be multiplied against a variable:

<ul>
<li>
2X+3Y is valid

<li>
XY is not valid

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
No Roots

<li>
No division of variables

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Decision Modeling-Solutions"><h2 id="Solutions">Solutions</h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
A solution is any choice of values for the decision variables:

<ul>
<li>
No constraints placed on the values

</ul>
<li>
Feasible Solution is a solution that satisfies all of the constraints:

<ul>
<li>
Must meet ALL constraints

<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
10/10 constraints

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Infeasible solution is a solution that doesn't satisfy all of the constraints:

<ul>
<li>
Fails at least one constraint

<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
A solution that meets 9/10 constraints is still infeasible

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Optimal solution is the best feasible solution:

<ul>
<li>
The best solution is relative to the OF 

<li>
Sometimes you are looking for the minimums and the smallest value is the best

<li>
Sometimes you are looking for the maximum solution and the highest is the best

</ul>
<li>
Talks specifically about the DVs values:

<ul>
<li>
Sometimes the solution is the answer to the question

</ul>
</ul>
