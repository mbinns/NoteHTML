Absorption Costing:

<ul>
<li>
All manufacturing costs both fixed and variable are assigned to units of product. Units are said to fully absorb manufacturing costs

<li>
Most countries, including the united states require some form of absorption

</ul>
<li>
Job Order Costing:

<ul>
<li>
Using in situations where many different products are produced each period.

<li>
Costs are traced back to the job and then divided by the number of units produced to arrive at an average cost per unit

</ul>
<li>
Computing predetermined Overhead Rates:

<ul>
<li>
Manufacturing overhead is an indirect cost, meaning that it is either difficult or impossible to trace it

<li>
Some costs in manufacturing overhead are variable and some are fixed

<li>
Allocation is used to assign overhead costs to products:

<ul>
<li>
Allocation Base is a measure such as direct labor hours or machine hours that is used to assign overhead costs to products

<li>

<pre>
Predetermined Overhead = Estimated total manufacturing overhead cost
                        ---------------------------------------------
                         Estimated total amount of allocation base
</pre>

</ul>
<li>
Predetermned overhead is calculated before the period begins (using estimates)

<ul>
<li>
Follows a 4 step process:

<ul>
<li>
Estimate the allocation base

<li>
Estimate total fixed manufacturing overhead cost

<ul>
<li>
OR Estimate variable manufacturing costs

</ul>
<li>
Use Y=a+bX:

<ul>
<li>
Y = estimated total manufacturing cost

<li>
a = estimated total fixed costs

<li>
b = estimated total variabe costs

<li>
X = allocation base

</ul>
<li>
Divide by allocation base to get predeturmined overhead by unit

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Applying manufacturing overhead

<ul>
<li>

<pre>
Overhead per job = Predetermined Rate X Allocation base for job
</pre>

<li>
This is called a normal cost system
