<ul>
<li>
Three basic principals:

<ul>
<li>
Voltage:

<ul>
<li>
Described as potential energy

<li>
Some kind of battery that has electric potential where current will flow from high to low

<li>
Volts

</ul>
<li>
Current:

<ul>
<li>
Flow of electricty from high to low

<li>
Amps

<li>
Electrons flow negative to positive, but we think of current as going positive to negative

</ul>
<li>
Resitance:

<ul>
<li>
Resists the flow of electricity

<li>
Ohms

<li>
Resitance decreases the amperage flowing through:

<ul>
<li>
Ohms Law is the measurement of this

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Ohms Law:

<ul>
<li>
V=IR

<li>
Voltage=CurrentxResitance

</ul>
<li>
Power:

<ul>
<li>
P=IV

<li>
Power=CurrentxVoltage

</ul>
<li>
Why does ohms law matter:

<ul>
<li>
Because you need to know how long a battery is going to last

<li>
And because some components act as resisters

<li>
Diodes:

<ul>
<li>
Restirct the flow of current in one direction

<li>
Typically have resisters in series to limit the current to the diaoded to stop it from blowing out

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Voltage divider:

<ul>
<li>
Anytime you have a voltage you want divided down you can use two resistors of the same resitance
<pre>
Voltage Divider:
---------------------
R2xVin
------ = Vout
R1+R2
</pre>

</ul>
<li>
Pull up and Pull down resistors:

<ul>
<li>
These are good for defining default behaviors
<pre>

MCU|---------------|Sensor

If both the sensor and MCU tries to send current at the same time a shortcuircut can happen
If no one sends any current then the current can drift, meaning that it could sometimes be a 1 or sometimes be a 0
    You want a baseline current through the wire

Pull Up
Both sides of the resistor are 5v
           5V
           Z
MCU|---------------|Sensor
The resistor in the middle between the MCU and the sensor will pull the drifitng voltage up to the source voltage
The higher the resistance the slower the shift to the source voltage

Pull Down
Both sides of th resistor are 0
MCU|---------------|Sensor
           Z
           Ground

The same in place as the pull up but this pull the voltage down to zero over time
You typically want the lowest resistence that gives you the behavior you want
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Reading a data sheet:

<ul>
<li>
First place to look would be the functional block diagram

<ul>
<li>
You want to look at how does it actually communicate:

<ul>
<li>
Some are digital and some are analogue

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Specifications table:

<ul>
<li>
Power consumption errors

</ul>
<li>
Absolute maximum ratings:

<ul>
<li>
Basically how would you break this

<li>
You should be fine to run <span id="CPSC 4820-8&#47;23&#47;16-8&#47;24&#47;16-Right"></span><strong id="Right">Right</strong> at this threshold

<li>
Temperature is important for soldering the device:

<ul>
<li>
Don't sit with a solder on the device

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
DigiKey:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.digikey.com">http://www.digikey.com</a>

<li>
Can find the same chips but packeged differently:

<ul>
<li>
May mean the prices are lower

<li>
Check the minimum quantity for the device

</ul>
<li>
Look around on sparkfun and get an idea of what you may want then use digikey

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="CPSC 4820-8&#47;23&#47;16-8&#47;26&#47;16"><h3 id="8&#47;26&#47;16">8/26/16</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Digital pins:

<ul>
<li>
Can be set to either high or low:

<ul>
<li>
In this case you get either 3.3v volts or 0v

</ul>
<li>
Digital write:

<ul>
<li>
Makes the pin havie wither high or low

</ul>
<li>
Digital read:

<ul>
<li>
Reads the voltage of the pin

</ul>
<li>
All digital pins can do analogue write

</ul>
<li>
Analogue:

<ul>
<li>
This does not allow you to specify an arbitrary value for voltage

<li>
Analogue, changes this by mapping to PWC:

<ul>
<li>
Lets say you wanted 50% it would be high for half and low for the other half while switching really quickly

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Pins have modes:

<ul>
<li>
Input:

<li>
Output

<li>
You need to ensure your mode is correct for what you are trying to do

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="CPSC 4820-8&#47;23&#47;16-8&#47;29&#47;16"><h3 id="8&#47;29&#47;16">8/29/16</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
How do you get the device to stop doing what its doing

<ul>
<li>
Hold the reset button

</ul>
<li>
Language reference sheet

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.energia.nu&#47;Reference_index.html">http://www.energia.nu/Reference_index.html</a>

</ul>
<li>
You can use double and floats on these devices but they don't have fpu (Floating Point Units):

<li>
Language overview:

<ul>
<li>
Interrupts

<ul>
<li>
Attach intterupts says if a particular pin does something then interrupts:

<ul>
<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
Everytime this button is push then I will now blink once then return back to the loop I was in before then

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Interrupts will get buffered... to a point but if you hold the interrupt context long enough then you cannot get back out

<ul>
<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
An infinite loop in an ISR will result in a stuck chunk of code

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
INLINE:

<ul>
<li>
This tells the compiler to not stick your function into a framestack which will allow your code to respond faster:

<li>
This will blow up your code though (Memory issue)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
SCK - Keeps everything syncronized

<li>
CSn - Use this pin to select the chip you want to talk to

<ul>
<li>
Uses active low, this means that it will be "on" when the voltage is low

</ul>
<li>
GDO2 - Ways to send an interrupt 

<li>
GDO0 - Ways to send an interrupt

<li>
C1101 API:

<ul>
<li>
void RX();

<ul>
<li>
sits and waits for messages, higher energy consumption

</ul>
<li>
void Sleep();

<ul>
<li>
Sleeps, and consumes very very little energy

</ul>
<li>
void WakeUp();

<ul>
<li>
Wakes up from sleep

</ul>
<li>
void SendData(uint8_t *txBuffer, uint8_t size);

<ul>
<li>
*NoWait

<li>
Sends data has a no wait version which will send data now and will not ensure you are not overwhelming the chip

</ul>
<li>
Rssi():

<ul>
<li>
maybe not very good for ranging tachnique

</ul>
</ul>

Debugging:

<ul>
<li>
What is the difference between embedded and standard software dev

<ul>
<li>
Visibility on what is happening

</ul>
<li>
Tools and steps:

<ul>
<li>
Use a multimeter to check if you have grounding issues

<li>
Use a multimeter to check if you have power going to vcc and grnd

<li>
Connect the multimeter to gpio pin and toggle it when you get to certain points of your code (kinda like printf)

</ul>
<li>
Ints on this board are 2 bytes or 16 bits

<li>
Serial.print() is capable of slowing down the board data

<li>
Don't use malloc because it can cause bugs that don't always show up

<li>

</ul>
</ul>
