What is an embedded system?

<ul>
<li>
There can be multiple definitions

<li>
A non-traditional computer with constraints:

<ul>
<li>
Power

<li>
Mobile

<li>
Memory

<li>
Specialized purpose 

</ul>

Three basic principals:

<ul>
<li>
Voltage:

<ul>
<li>
Described as potential energy

<li>
Some kind of battery that has electric potential where current will flow from high to low

<li>
Volts

</ul>
<li>
Current:

<ul>
<li>
Flow of electricty from high to low

<li>
Amps

<li>
Electrons flow negative to positive, but we think of current as going positive to negative

</ul>
<li>
Resitance:

<ul>
<li>
Resists the flow of electricity

<li>
Ohms

<li>
Resitance decreases the amperage flowing through:

<ul>
<li>
Ohms Law is the measurement of this

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Ohms Law:

<ul>
<li>
V=IR

<li>
Voltage=CurrentxResitance

</ul>
<li>
Power:

<ul>
<li>
P=IV

<li>
Power=CurrentxVoltage

</ul>
<li>
Why does ohms law matter:

<ul>
<li>
Because you need to know how long a battery is going to last

<li>
And because some components act as resisters

<li>
Diodes:

<ul>
<li>
Restirct the flow of current in one direction

<li>
Typically have resisters in series to limit the current to the diaoded to stop it from blowing out

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Voltage divider:

<ul>
<li>
Anytime you have a voltage you want divided down you can use two resistors of the same resitance
<pre>
Voltage Divider:
---------------------
R2xVin
------ = Vout
R1+R2
</pre>

</ul>
<li>
Pull up and Pull down resistors:

<ul>
<li>
These are good for defining default behaviors
<pre>

MCU|---------------|Sensor

If both the sensor and MCU tries to send current at the same time a shortcuircut can happen
If no one sends any current then the current can drift, meaning that it could sometimes be a 1 or sometimes be a 0
    You want a baseline current through the wire

Pull Up
Both sides of the resistor are 5v
           5V
           Z
MCU|---------------|Sensor
The resistor in the middle between the MCU and the sensor will pull the drifitng voltage up to the source voltage
The higher the resistance the slower the shift to the source voltage

Pull Down
Both sides of th resistor are 0
MCU|---------------|Sensor
           Z
           Ground

The same in place as the pull up but this pull the voltage down to zero over time
You typically want the lowest resistence that gives you the behavior you want
