<div id="Chapter 2-Cash Flow Identity-Operating Cash Flow:-Cash Flow From Assets"><h4 id="Cash Flow From Assets">Cash Flow From Assets</h4></div>
<ul>
<li>
A growing company typically has a negative cash flow from assets because they are expanding rapidly and are taking on new debit

<li>
They may have a big Capitol Spending Project like a new more modern factory:

<ul>
<li>
That would be an okay reason to have a negative flow

</ul>
<li>
They may have to comply with gov't regulations:

<ul>
<li>
Won't make the company any more money

<li>
Wouldn't be a good reason to have a negative flow

<li>
We are looking to see if the company can pay its bills in the next year

Short term creditors are interested in this ration

<li>
3 Ratios:

<ul>
<li>
Current Ratio:

<ul>
<li>
\(\frac{Cur\ Assets} {Cur\ Liab}\)

<li>
This might not a good thing because the returns are low unless the company plans on using it quickly

<li>
Want the ratio to be at least one:

<ul>
<li>
If the ratio is less than one you have more debt then money to pay it

</ul>
<li>
If you sell some merchandise out of inventory your Curr ratio will go up

</ul>
<li>
Quick Ratio:

<ul>
<li>
\(\frac{Cur\ Assets - Inv} {Cur\ Liab}\)

<li>
Shows how much of their money is in inventory

<li>
Could mean a few things:

<ul>
<li>
The company may not be selling their inventory

<li>
The company may have over produced

<li>
This typically means you should ask questions about the inventory

</ul>
<li>
If you sell current inventory for cash then then quick ratio will decrease

<ul>
<li>
Because your inventory and current assets don't mirror one another in this ratio

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Cash Ratio:

<ul>
<li>
\(\frac{Cash} {Cur\ Liabs}\)

<li>
How much cash they have on hand compared to how much debt they have that may need to be paid
