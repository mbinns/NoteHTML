<ul>
<li>
Vulnerabilities could be addressed but due to economics they are not

<li>
Currently it costs the US 180b

<ul>
<li>
Katrina cost 100b

<li>
Security issues cost the united states roughly 2 Katrina's a year

</ul>
<li>
Fatal software errors

<ul>
<li>
Therac-25 radiation therapy:

<ul>
<li>
Killed patients in the machine with over doses in radiation

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Fuzzing of 802.11 network interfaces:

<ul>
<li>
TCP/IP network stack used to be hard coded

<li>
Now it is SDN

<li>
Sending of random packets to the interfaces could cause a buffer overflow in the SD radio of the wireless interface

<ul>
<li>
The buffer overflow allowed them to write to kernel memory space

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
End user license agreements nullify the responsibility of the producer of software:

<ul>
<li>
Codified in law

<li>
"No action may be brought for the negligent design of manufacture of computer hardware computer software or firmware"

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
New versions are not released to fix bugs but they are released because new features sell software

<ul>
<li>
45% of features are never used

<ul>
<li>
why would you pay to debug it?

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
With security and computers you cannot tell the difference between the good and bad products

<li>
Everyone buys the bad cheap products because you can't tell a quality difference between the good and bad ones

<li>
So therefore companies only produce MVP which are typically bad

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Clear text goes into encryption function

<li>
Results of encryption is cipher text

<li>
Decryption function can get the resulting clear text from the cipher text

<li>
If both the encryption and decryption function have the key this is called symmetric key

<li>
If the keys are different for both decryption and encryption then its called asymmetric key

</ul>

<div id="Cryptography-Attacking-Cipher Text"><h3 id="Cipher Text">Cipher Text</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Attacking cipher text you look for pattern repetition

<li>
For example in a Cesar Cipher you look for the letter repeated the most and use that as your key

</ul>

<div id="Cryptography-Attacking-Vigenere Cipher"><h3 id="Vigenere Cipher">Vigenere Cipher</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
A sequence of Cesar Ciphers strung together and to attack you looked for correlation of repeating letters based on index shifts

<li>
Example)

<ul>
<li>
Shift the string by one index and look for the correlations of repeating letters

<li>
Repeat

<li>
Look for peaks in the repeating letters and use that as the offset

</ul>
</ul>
