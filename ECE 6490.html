<li>
Vulnerabilities could be addressed but due to economics they are not

<li>
Currently it costs the US 180b

<ul>
<li>
Katrina cost 100b

<li>

</ul>
<li>
Fatal software errors

<ul>

Fuzzing of 802.11 network interfaces:

<ul>
<li>
TCP/IP network stack used to be hard coded

<li>
Now it is SDN

<li>
Sending of random packets to the interfaces could cause a buffer overflow in the SD radio of the wireless interface

<ul>
<li>
The buffer overflow allowed them to write to kernel memory space

</ul>

End user license agreements nullify the responsibility of the producer of software:

<ul>
<li>
Codified in law

<ul>
<li>
New versions are not released to fix bugs but they are released because new features sell software

<ul>
<li>
45% of features are never used

<ul>
<li>
why would you pay to debug it?

<ul>
<li>
With security and computers you cannot tell the difference between the good and bad products

<li>
Everyone buys the bad cheap products because you can't tell a quality difference between the good and bad ones

<li>
