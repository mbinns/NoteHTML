The HB gary attack

<ul>
<li>
Used SQL injection to gain access to the CMS server

<li>
Then they used a rainbow table to crack the password hashes:

<ul>
<li>
A Rainbow table is similar to a hybrid dictionary attack in that it takes a word list and runs through all the words but then it starts changing letters in the word to common substitutions (I.E. a 0 for an o) this table is pregenerated to take some of the computational load off the system while cracking

</ul>
<li>
After recovering a password they then used it to log into the webserver and used an escalation exploit to gain administrator access

<li>
The pivioted to the email server and used the emails to social engineer access to other machines

</ul>
<li>
Lessons Learned from HBGary Hack:

<ul>
<li>
Use off the shelf software

<li>
Patching!

<li>
Store passwords with stronger security

<ul>
<li>
They used MD5 with no iterative hashing or salting

</ul>
<li>
Force complex passwords

<li>
Don't reuse passwords

<li>
Delete sensitive e-mails

<ul>
<li>
An email containing the root password for the rootkit.com site

</ul>
<li>
Educate against social engineering

</ul>
</ul>

Defining Security:

<ul>
<li>
The security of a system, application, or protocol is always relative to a few things:

<ul>
<li>
A set of desired properties

<li>
An adversary with specific capabilities

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
CIA

<li>
Confidentiality:

<ul>
<li>
Avoidance of unauthorized disclosure of information

<li>
Protection of data

<li>
Providing access to those who are allowed to see it

<li>
Disallowing access to everyone else

<li>
Tools for confidentiality:

<ul>
<li>
Encryption:

<ul>
<li>
Public and private keys so what when data is transmitted it is unreadable

</ul>
<li>
ACL/Authorization:

<ul>
<li>
Rules and policies that limit access to configential info

<li>
Access can be determinied by many factorsr:

<ul>
<li>
What you are:

<ul>
<li>
Biometrics

<li>
Roles

</ul>
<li>
What you know:

<ul>
<li>
Username

<li>
Password

</ul>
<li>
What you have:

<ul>
<li>
Smartcard

<li>
Keys

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Physical security:

<ul>
<li>
Locks

<li>
Doors

<li>
Windowless rooms

<li>
Sounds dampening

<li>
Faraday Cages

<li>
Air gap

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Integrity:

<ul>
<li>
The data is still in its original form and not been altered

<li>
Tools for intergrity:

<ul>
<li>
Backups:

<li>
Checksum:

<ul>
<li>
The computation of a function that maps the contents of a file to a cumerical value, A checksum function depends on the entire contents of a file and is designed in a way that even a small change to the input is likely to result in a different outut from the hash funciton

</ul>
<li>
Data corecting codes:

<ul>
<li>
Method for storing where small changes can be seen and fixed

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Availability:

<ul>
<li>
The property of data where it is ready to be used in a timely manner

<li>
Tools for availability:

<ul>
<li>
Computational redundancies:

<ul>
<li>
Computers and storage devices that serve as fallbacks in the case of failures

</ul>
<li>
Physical protections:

<ul>
<li>
Infranstructure meant to keep information avaiable even in the even of physical challenges (Natrual disasters)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Other security concepts:

<ul>
<li>
A.A.A:

<ul>
<li>
Authenticity:

<ul>
<li>
Ability to determine the assureance properties are genuine

<li>
Authenticity tools:

<ul>
<li>
digital signatures:

<ul>
<li>
Systems commit to the authenticity of thier documents with nonrepudiation (no take backsies)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Assurance:

<ul>
<li>
Refers to how trust is provided and managed in computer systems

<li>
Trust management:

<ul>
<li>
Policies:

<ul>
<li>
Behavioral expectations that people or systems must follow

</ul>
<li>
Permissions:

<ul>
<li>
Describe behaviors allowed by agents that interact with a system

</ul>
<li>
Protections:

<ul>
<li>
mechanisms put in place to enforce permissions and policies

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Anonymity:

<ul>
<li>
Certian records  cannot be attributed to any individual

<li>
Toos for anonymity:

<ul>
<li>
Aggregation of data:

<ul>
<li>
Mixing of all data so it is harder to pin down on one user

</ul>
<li>
Mixing:

<ul>
<li>
Interwinning of transactions, information, or communication in a way that cannot be traced to any individual

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Threats and Attacks:

<ul>
<li>
Eavesdripping:

<ul>
<li>
Intercepting of information on its way to its destination

<li>
Packet sniffing

<li>
An attack on confidentiality

</ul>
<li>
Alteration:

<ul>
<li>
MITM Attacks

<ul>
<li>
Where an attacker has a network stream sent to them where it can be copied, modified, and then retransmitted

</ul>
<li>
Attack on Confidentiality, Integrity

</ul>
<li>
DOS:

<ul>
<li>
Itteruption in a service by sending lots of traffic/data to a server

<li>
Attack on avaibality

</ul>
<li>
Masquerading(Impersinating):

<ul>
<li>
Social engineering attacks like phishing and spoofing 

<li>
An attack on authenticity/confidentiality/anonymity

</ul>
<li>
Repudiation:

<ul>
<li>
Denail of a commitment or data receipt

<li>
Attempting to back out in the middle of a protocol that requires the differnet parties to provide receipts ack that they have gotten data

<li>
Attack on assurance

</ul>
<li>
Correlation and traceback:

<ul>
<li>
The integration of multiple data sources and information flows to figureout the source of information

<li>
An attack on anonymity

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Authentication v Authorization:

<ul>
<li>
Authentication:

<ul>
<li>
Who or what can access a system

<li>
