The HB gary attack

<ul>
<li>
Used SQL injection to gain access to the CMS server

<li>
Then they used a rainbow table to crack the password hashes:

<ul>
<li>
A Rainbow table is similar to a hybrid dictionary attack in that it takes a word list and runs through all the words but then it starts changing letters in the word to common substitutions (I.E. a 0 for an o) this table is pregenerated to take some of the computational load off the system while cracking

</ul>
<li>
After recovering a password they then used it to log into the webserver and used an escalation exploit to gain administrator access

<li>
The pivioted to the email server and used the emails to social engineer access to other machines

</ul>
<li>
Lessons Learned from HBGary Hack:

<ul>
<li>
Use off the shelf software

<li>
Patching!

<li>
Store passwords with stronger security

<ul>
<li>
They used MD5 with no iterative hashing or salting

</ul>
<li>
Force complex passwords

<li>
Don't reuse passwords

<li>
Delete sensitive e-mails

<ul>
<li>
An email containing the root password for the rootkit.com site

</ul>
<li>
Educate against social engineering

</ul>

<li>
Defining Security:

<ul>
<li>
The security of a system, application, or protocol is always relative to a few things:

<ul>
<li>
A set of desired properties

<li>
An adversary with specific capabilities

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
CIA

<li>
Confidentiality:

<ul>
<li>
Avoidance of unauthorized disclosure of information

<li>
Protection of data

<li>
Providing access to those who are allowed to see it

<li>
Disallowing access to everyone else

<li>
Tools for confidentiality:

<ul>
<li>
Encryption:

<ul>
<li>
Public and private keys so what when data is transmitted it is unreadable

</ul>
<li>
ACL/Authorization:

<ul>
<li>

<li>
Access can be determinied by many factorsr:

<ul>
<li>

<li>
Roles

</ul>
<li>
What you know:

<li>
Tools for intergrity:

<ul>
<li>
Backups:

<li>
Checksum:

<ul>
<li>
The computation of a function that maps the contents of a file to a cumerical value, A checksum function depends on the entire contents of a file and is designed in a way that even a small change to the input is likely to result in a different outut from the hash funciton

</ul>
<li>
Data corecting codes:

<ul>
<li>
Method for storing where small changes can be seen and fixed

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>

<li>
Just encrypt is

</ul>
<li>
