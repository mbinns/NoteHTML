<div id="Thursday test-Cognative Walkthrough"><h2 id="Cognative Walkthrough">Cognative Walkthrough</h2></div>
<p>
Have a user of an expert walkthrough the process similar to a thinkaloud but 
it is not the same thing.
</p>

<p>
Difference between thinkaloud and cognative
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Thinkaloud

<ul>
<li>
Describe your feelings about the interface

<li>
Why they are preforming the actions they are

<li>
Novice users

</ul>
<li>
Cognative

<ul>
<li>
Experts are doing the test and you are not describing feelings

<li>
Trying to get into the mindset of the novice users

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Similarites between thinkaloud and cognative
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trying to identify where users are going to get off task

<li>
Inspection method

<ul>
<li>
Have experts inspect a particular interface or prototype

<li>
Can be preformed in the early stages of design

<ul>
<li>
Most bang for your buck 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
We ask specific questions as we step through the interface

<ul>
<li>
Will users be trying to produce whatever effect a particular action has

<li>
Will users notice a correct action is visible

<li>
Will the user associate the correct action with the effect to be achived

<li>
Will users understand feedback after action

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Cognative Walkthroughs are really well suited to first time users doing
exploaratory learnng with out any formal training. You are typing to imagine 
what a novice user might encounter when using a system.

<div id="Thursday test-Cognative Walkthrough-Requirements"><h3 id="Requirements">Requirements</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Who will be the users of the system

<li>
What tasks will be analyzed

<li>
What is the correct action sequence for each task

<ul>
<li>
What is the path that the users must take to complete the task at hand

</ul>
<li>
Decription or implementation of the interface

<ul>
<li>
Doesn't have to be something that is up and running

<ul>
<li>
Could be a prototype or a very good description of the system 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Usability experts (1-4)

<ul>
<li>
3 - 4 is the ideal number

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Thursday test-Cognative Walkthrough-Assumptions"><h3 id="Assumptions">Assumptions</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
A user may have some similar cultural background so that they would be familiar with a particular metaphore

<li>
Similar Physical abilities

<li>
The user should have a <em>Goal</em> defined

<ul>
<li>
Vague goals do not lend themselves well to a cognative walkthrough

</ul>
<li>
The user will explore

<ul>
<li>
Older users maybe afraid to that they are going to break the system

</ul>
<li>
The users are going to choose something that seems reasonable 

<li>
The user is able to interpret the response from the system correctly

</ul>

<div id="Thursday test-Cognative Walkthrough-Process"><h3 id="Process">Process</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Finding some collegues to participate in it with you

<li>
Define some tasks

<li>
Define the sequence of actions that ideally would allow users to accomplesh a particular goal

<li>
Take notes and keep track of things noted

<li>
Analyise data

</ul>

<div id="Thursday test-Cognative Walkthrough-Methodology"><h3 id="Methodology">Methodology</h3></div>
<p>
As a walkthrough is being conducted record your assumptions
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Assumptions about what would cause problems and why they are recorded- why users face difficulties

<li>
Notes about side issues and design changes

<li>
Summary of results

</ul>

<p>
Design is revised to fix the problems presented
