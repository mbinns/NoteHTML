<li>
If you don't directly deal with the problem then you allow the problem to come back and erupt:

<ul>

You need to sit down and talk about the problem with the employee

<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
Using layoffs a solution to remove the problem from the workplace

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Intervention at an early stage has a high chance of stopping the escalation of the problem

Using a constant policy and procedure to deal with the problem:

<ul>
<li>
Document the incident and started to determine if it should be reported

<li>
This is a strong justification to monitor and review the employee at the very least

<ul>
<li>
Interview Employee

Interview Supervisor

<li>
When early warning signals occur and document them

<li>
Enforce company policy that sends the message that the behavior is not acceptable

</ul>
<li>
A matrix of legal issues must be resolved

<li>
Termination is not necessary going to encourage workplace violence to occur in fact it may be the wakeup call that is needed for the employee to reflect upon his thoughts and actions
