<ul>
<li>
Components

<li>
Common Goal

<li>
Interrelationships how they work together

</ul>
<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
An Assembly line

<ul>
<li>
An Assembly line is an example of a system because it has multiple components such as the people putting the parts on to the item being assembled. And each person is adding on the next part until the goal of a complete object is reached

</ul>
</ul>
<li>

<li>
Output:

<ul>
<li>
Components that are holding/present the finalized data

</ul>
<li>

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Systems Thinking:

<ul>
<li>
A process of understanding how the parts of a system impacts the whole

<li>
A problem solving approach that looks at the whole system to possibly identify which part(s) of the system where the problem could occur

<li>
A set of habits and practices based on the philosophy that components of any system can best be understood how they are related to one another and to the system

</ul>

It is better to use a standard systems dev process methodology in an organization:

<li>
The employees will have more practice working within the system becoming efficient due to having lots of experience with it

<li>
The employees will be able to communicate between groups more effectively

<li>
Allows you to "debug" the system development process and possibly improve different aspects of it over the course of time "Better Quality Control"

<ul>
<li>
Inhouse:

<ul>
<li>
Pros:

<ul>
<li>
More tailored methodology:

<ul>
<li>
You can utilize the skill set of your employees better

</ul>
<li>
If dev needs match the resources the company has then you can implement it cheaper

<li>
Cheaper to maintain because you have the internal people working on it

<li>
Also more flexible to accept updates

</ul>
<li>
Cons:

<ul>
<li>
More expensive to build and maintain if your company does not have the resources or skills to do so

<li>
May be misaligned to your business strategy/vision to build

<li>
Takes longer to develop using time/money/resources in "perfecting" the methodology

<li>
Improvement to the methodology will be slower

<li>
Outside contractors will have to learn your methodology

<li>
People who leave your organization don't have transferable skills

<li>
As the org moves from lvl 1 to level 5

<ul>
<li>
Project management and process management capabilities are put into place and become more efficient

<li>
Reactive -&gt; Proactive management of project and process

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
level 1:

<ul>
<li>
"Anarchy"

<li>
Any given org will start at level one in their software development abilities

<li>
If the team has high skills and experience in software dev they may have good success

<ul>
<li>
If there is low skill/exp then the team will fail

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
level 2:

<ul>
<li>
"Repeatable"

<li>
First time Project management capabilities in place:

<ul>
<li>
They are consistently monitoring three key things of project management:

<ul>
<li>
Deadlines

<li>
Budget

<li>
First time quality

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Since there is no consistent process in place everyone is doing their own thing

</ul>
<li>
level 3:

<ul>
<li>
Defined

<li>
First time Process management is implemented

<ul>
<li>
Use a single systems development methodology across the whole org

<li>
Takes advantage of the pros of the single methodology 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
level 4:

<ul>
<li>
"Managed"

<li>
Becoming proactive rather than reactionary in regards to project management

<li>
Capable of improving the practices they use for project management

</ul>
<li>
level 5:

<ul>
<li>
Becoming proactive rather than reactionary in regards to process management

<li>
Capable of improving the practices they use for process management

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Chapter 3-2&#47;14&#47;17-Core Principles in Process Development"><h3 id="Core Principles in Process Development">Core Principles in Process Development</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
There are ten core principles in process development

<ol>
<li>
Get system users involved:

<ol>
<li>
To eliminate miscommunication between users and the developers

<li>
They will be more apt to take the system and use it

<li>
Can help identify problems and successes with the system

</ol>
<li>
Employ a problem solving approach:

<ol>
<li>
This will help keep you on the rails

</ol>
<li>
Establish Phases and activities:

<ol>
<li>
This will break up the process into small subprocess and will define the steps you need to take to complete and move to the next step

</ol>
<li>
Document through the process:

<ol>
<li>
This is to give you the ability to retrace your steps

<li>
Also give you the ability to improve the system you are working on

<li>
You need to document because you will not be the only one looking at the system

</ol>
<li>
Establish Standards:

<ol>
<li>
Ensure that the org is using the same process for the systems they are developing

<ol>
<li>
This is because everything needs to be able to integrate when put together and if they all use different processes they will not work well with one another

</ol>
<li>


</ol>
<li>
Manage the Process and Projects

<ol>
<li>
Manage:

<ol>
<li>
Time

<li>
Budget

<li>
Quality

</ol>
<li>
Also manage:

<ol>
<li>
How

</ol>
</ol>
<li>
Justify system based on capital benefit:

<ol>
<li>
Cost/Benefit analysis

<li>
This makes it easier for the owners to justify the cost of a system

</ol>
<li>
Don't be afraid to cancel or revise scope

<ol>
<li>
Defines the systems goals so that you know what it is and what it can and cant do

</ol>
<li>
Divide and conquer:

<ol>
<li>
You are more likely to build a system that users will like

<li>
Minimize risk:

<ol>
<li>
This is because you only build little portions of the system and you can build on it/change it/cut losses

</ol>
<li>
Allows the users many more points of interaction

<li>
What if you run out of money in the middle of the project:

<ol>
<li>
If you broke down the project into smaller subsystems at any given time you will have a usable system

</ol>
</ol>
<li>
Design systems for growth and change

</ol>
</ul>

Whether or not this is worth pursuing

<li>
Initial scope, I.E. What the project is going to cover

<li>
Initial plan is set at the end of this phase

<li>
Problem statement matrix:

<ul>
<li>
This is a preliminary list of problems what is causing you to embark on the project

</ul>
<li>
People involved:

<ul>
<li>
Owners

<li>
System Analysis

<li>
Project managers

</ul>

<div id="Chapter 7-2&#47;23&#47;17-Problem Analysis Phase"><h3 id="Problem Analysis Phase">Problem Analysis Phase</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
This phase is about digging into the problems that were outlined in the scope definition phase

<li>
Questions you should ask your self

<ul>
<li>
Are the problems really worth solving?

<li>
Is a new system really worth building?

<li>
This gives you the ability to have the creeping commitment where you only do bits and pieces at a time

<li>
Will the benefits of building the system outweigh the costs

</ul>
<li>
Typically takes 6-8weeks

</ul>

<div id="Chapter 7-2&#47;23&#47;17-Key Purpose of P.A. Phase"><h3 id="Key Purpose of P.A. Phase">Key Purpose of P.A. Phase</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
3 fold:

<ul>
<li>
Understand the problem domain:

<ul>
<li>
Refers to the context of the problem

<li>
This can be thought of as they current way the org does a task:

<ul>
<li>
What processes they have in place

<li>
Flow of work

<li>
Flow of information

<li>
ETC.

</ul>
<li>
Also the vocab that is going to be used in the current way of working

</ul>
<li>
Cause and effect analysis:

<ul>
<li>
This is of the preliminary problems/opportunities/directives from the Scope Def phase

<li>
Some of these problems will share a root cause and this phases will help you isolate the root cause of many of the problems you identified in the matrix

</ul>
<li>
Develop system improvements objectives and constraints:

<ul>
<li>
Improvement objectives

<ul>
<li>
This is how this process would be improved 

</ul>
<li>
Constraints:

<ul>
<li>
Each improvement is also accompanied by a constraint:

<ul>
<li>
Constraints can be:

<ul>
<li>
Time

<li>
Money

<li>
ETC.

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
This helps keep expectations grounded

<ul>
<li>
Deliverable 1

<ul>
<li>
Understanding the problem domain:

<li>
Generally don't draw a lot of models in this phase, typically a tabular approach

<li>
Problem domain matrix and scope matrix are communicating different things:

<ul>
<li>
Problem domain matrix lists out the <span id="Chapter 7-2&#47;23&#47;17-Key Deliverables of the P.A. Phase-current"></span><strong id="current">current</strong> process for doing things in the org

<li>
Scope statements matrix lists out the <span id="Chapter 7-2&#47;23&#47;17-Key Deliverables of the P.A. Phase-future"></span><strong id="future">future</strong> process for doing things

</ul>
<li>
Problem domain matrix:

<ul>
<li>
Data knowledge:

<ul>
<li>
So rather than say just customer you would say, customer - someone who has bought something

<li>
This allows granular control over implementation details for specific events

</ul>
<li>
Process:

<ul>
<li>
list and define all business events to which the system responds:

<ul>
<li>
I.E. a customer places an order

<li>
There may be multiple ways for an event to happen list all of them

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Communication:

<ul>
<li>
List and define all people business units and other IS that interact with the system

<ul>
<li>
Includes the location where current system is used
